# Noteplan Theme Test Note
#test #draft #preview #theme
---

> This is a special note that has been created to allow for the quick previewing of theme styling using all of the elements that Noteplan supports.

## Text Styling
Regular paragraph text displays here. If you keep reading you can see some inline **Bold** and *Italic* text too. Just for fun, and if the theme supports it, here is some text that is both ***bold and italic***. 
In addition to the basic styling such as bold and italic, some Noteplan themes support the use of ~~strikethrough~~ and ~underlined~ text. It may also be possible to ==highlight== some passages in-line or to mark something as being formatted `code`.  

## Links and Tags
Noteplan supports [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) in the in-app editor. This is what Noteplan theme files provide styling information for. In addition Noteplan also supports wiki linking *(aka: back linking)* to connect notes and ideas together, as well as allowing hashtags and mentions: #test_tag @test_mention

- **01.** Raw Text Link: http://noteplan.co 
- **02.** Markdown Link: [Apple](www.apple.com)
- **03.** A Wikilink *(or backlink)*: [[linked note]]

## Tasks and Lists
Noteplan supports three list types: `unordered lists` and `ordered lists` as well as `task lists`. Tasks can be marked as *completed*, *scheduled* or *cancelled*.

- Unordered List item
1. Ordered List item
- [ ] Open task
- [-] Cancelled task
- [x] Completed task @done(2021-03-11 04:53 PM)
- [ ] ! This is a priority task #important
